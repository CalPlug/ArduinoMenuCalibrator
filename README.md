Description:  This menu driven script provides the capability for using regression to determine fitting coefficients for linear, quadratic, power, exponential and logarithmic functions from input data.  It can be used for sensor calibration.  After reading values it will allow the saving of fitting cofficients into onboard EEPROM.  It has been tested on Arduino Uno.
