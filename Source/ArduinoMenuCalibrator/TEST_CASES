1.Appending a linear, quadratic, exponential,logarithmic function on a virgin board
  ;result: WORKS, it basically 'overwrites'.
2.Overwriting linear, quadratic, exponential,logarithmic function on a configured board
  ;result: WORKS, it overwrites existing memory, and updates the whereToWriteTo field correctly.

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. Some decimal numbers are not written completely the same, but they only differ in the last decimal. So the error is less than 1%.
2. Nth order regression sometimes functions correctly if given reasonable points, and a low Nth order (less than 3), but sometimes overflows.
